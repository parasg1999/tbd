> Good morning! 

I'm actually confused whether I can call this early or late. On one hand, I'm starting at 4 in the morning, and on the other hand, I'm writing after a month.

The first order of business for the day is to fix the SHIB price issue on the website I made for comparing crypto prices across Indian exchanges [coincompare.in](https://coincomapre.in). The problem is that the coinswitch APIs are really unreliable, and when it gives data, I increase it by a percentage and then the final prices are calculated. Now this API gives the SHIB price as `0.00` which meant that the price is the cheapest there is for anything 🤷‍♂️

Fixed the issue by creating a utility function, and planning to extend it by creating a price history collection to store all the historical prices. Need to also think about the deployments! Currently I have to log into all of the hosts separately to deploy on each of them, seems to be a good time to learn about auto pull or hook URLs I guess.

Now, I'll be working on creating the discord form for the events like [discord.mlh.io](discord.mlh.io). This will be helpful in gathering the data for future participants and help with the outreach and marketing. I'm thinking of creating a Next.js application with Tailwind since it seems like the best way to get a custom form up and running quickly. Let's get started.

> Decided to make it open source as [discord-guard](https://github.com/parasg1999/discord-guard) 

Checlist for the features  

[x] Login using Discord.  
[x] Persistent data storage.  
[ ] Get/Set data only from persistent storage

Made a basic Next app with Discord login and database storage. Added database storage to it. Looking good for scratch.

> Probably a long break 😬, gotta earn that paycheck!
