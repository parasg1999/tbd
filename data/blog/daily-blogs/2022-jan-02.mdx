### 21:24

A little late to write the first entry but I thought I had to write it after I set up this seemingly impossible thing. A lot has happened over the last year and I have been using a company provided Macbook for my development activities for the last couple of months. All of that makes me wanna neglect my PC due to different key combinations to be honest. You spend all day working on a Mac and then you go back to linux and all you can do is press `Alt + C` to copy and wonder why nothing is getting pasted when you press `Alt + V` ðŸ¤¦

So I decided to make my PC an SSH server so I can develop in Mac but the environments are separated. No pain, IKR!

It also feels a little nostalgic to come back to this thing again. I've just made a small change here, renaming it to `Daily Diary` instead of `Daily Programming Diary` since most of the time I'm doing stuff for the company which I can't write here, but let's see how this goes, and what else I do apart from programming.

There is no plan right now, but I'll probably be working on something in the coming days. I also wanna focus on stuff other than coding this year, no no, we don't do resolutions. Although I do wanna learn about finance ðŸ’° and guitar ðŸŽ¸

Joining a new team tomorrow, really excited! THEY WORK ON REACT!

No checklist for today. See ya tomorrow!

> Goodnight!
