> Good morning!

Starting early today with some basic learning and setting up. Need to set up the chrome developement environment for Flutter and will be reading the documentation after that.

### 10:39

Finally set up the development version but another pitfall of using this SSH based environment is that I can't run my Flutter browser here, and port forwarding is not happening. Now I'll just read the documentation and see what exactly this is, and how to get started.

Came across a basic app to generate a list of names on the official documentation and it just feels like it is way over complicated to develop. I get the idea that having widgets make it easier to stitch different pieces together, but it just feels like a lot of effort. Anyway, I feel this feeling will go away with time.

### 11:50

Had a meeting with Deepesh, where we discussed about the project and how to get started. Now that the boilerplate is ready I can get started on developing the backend while I learn Flutter.

> Back to Amazon work!

> I slept for a bit ðŸ™ˆ

### 21:20

I'm back here but I don't feel like working anymore. I'll just read a book and head for the night!

> Bye!
