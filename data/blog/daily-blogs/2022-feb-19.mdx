> Good Morning!

I'm gonna resume working on `Discord Guard`. Currently, the user can log in to Discord, and have their details displayed. Although I'll say that the UI is very bad. I'll attempt to fix that, and also want to create an Edit Profile Page, where currently I'll just add the Name to be editable, but can modify it later on.

I have completed the Profile page UI, looking okay IMO. I mean looks exactly like MLH discord 😬❗️ So now, I need to create an Edit page. I'll use the same base classes as those in the Profile page since it looks really similar. 

### 4:15

The UI part of this project is COMPLETED 😮‍💨. Did I forget to mention I don't like working with UI⁉️ Uff. Now gonna work on updating the name of the user when the submit button is clicked. Will be looking at the API side of `Next.js` now.

Seems like I needed to update the user model and fix some things I had done earlier. I am keeping two fields now for the name. One will be the username that Discord provides, and the other will be the name that the user wants to be displayed on the site. I think that makes more sense otherwise we can't recognise users on Discord. 

### 5:07
Done with the project. Made the final commit. One thing off my plate! Damn this took way more effort than I thought it would

> Adios for now 😉
