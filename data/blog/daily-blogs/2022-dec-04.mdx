Damn, it feels like forever since I last wrote here. A lot has happened.

Let's get to work. So I'm working on a project and I need to make backend for firebase phone auth. 
Will be using a sample react app to test it and hopefully all goes well. Need to do this ASAP!

1. Creating a firebase project.
2. Get a React project up and running, so I can see the firebase responses/
3. Use the auth token to check if the backend gives any errors.
4. Integrate with backend, and get rid of the react project.

So yeah, took like an hour, but the firebase auth is ready at the backend.
