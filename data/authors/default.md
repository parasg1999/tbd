_**Not really a fan of addressing myself as the 3rd person, so yeah here you go.**_

I am a Software Developer, and have a major crush on Javascript. I have mainly been working with Node.js and React, and been trying to document my developer journey here just to be accountable to myself.

This blog will be from Jan, 2022. Maybe it's not something you would like to know but IF you wanna see my previous blogs, you can find them at [parasg1999.github.io](https://parasg1999.github.io)
